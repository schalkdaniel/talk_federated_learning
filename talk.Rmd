# Federated/Decentralized Learning

##

\addtocounter{framenumber}{-1}

Federated Learning as learning on decentralized data with the following properties:

-   **Non-IID** The training data on a given client is typically based on the usage of the mobile device by a particular user, and hence any particular userâ€™s local dataset will not be representative of the population distribution.

-   **Unbalanced** Similarly, some users will make much heavier use of the service or app than others, leading to varying amounts of local training data.

-   **Massively distributed** We expect the number of clients participating in an optimization to be much larger than the average number of examples per client.

-   **Limited communication** Mobile devices are frequently offline or on slow or expensive connections.
